## Data & Privacy

All data is stored exclusively in your browser's `localStorage`. Nothing is sent to any server. You can export a full JSON backup from **Profile → Export Data** and re-import it on another device.

## Deployment

The app is deployed to GitHub Pages at:  
**https://mge-agilos.github.io/bodycoaching/**

The `next.config.js` sets `basePath` and `assetPrefix` to `/bodycoaching` for correct asset resolution on GitHub Pages.

To deploy manually after building:

```bash
npm run build
# Upload the out/ directory to your static host
```
